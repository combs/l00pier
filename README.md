# l00pier
Loopin' Louie, but loopier.

_by @mattgrosso and @combs_

## Modes

- **Random speeds**, gradually changed, reverting to normal speed between each random speed
- **User-controlled speed**, perhaps played by a fifth player
- **Normal speed**

## Requirements

- Arduino (most types should be fine)
- Motor driver (L298N, say) 
- Mode switch(es)
- Potentiometer for user-controlled speed
- More than 5V power source, such as 4xAA

## Future Ideas

- Random mode: Reverse speed occasionally
- Random mode: Variable period
